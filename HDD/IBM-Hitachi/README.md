Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both rating
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days   — avg. days per sample,
Err    — avg. errors per sample,
Rating — avg. rating per sample.
